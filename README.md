# Vessel-Segmentation-for-Diabetic-Retinopathy-detection
This project involves implementing vessel segmentation for diabetic retinopathy assessment using the DRIVE dataset. It focuses on extracting key metrics—such as vessel density, tortuosity, width, and length—and optimizing the preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline to improve segmentation consistency.
