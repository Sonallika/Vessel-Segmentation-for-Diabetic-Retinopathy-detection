# Vessel Segmentation for Diabetic Retinopathy
This project implements an image processing pipeline for vessel segmentation in retinal images using the DRIVE dataset. It preprocesses the images, applies thresholding and morphological operations, and extracts vessel structures to calculate key metrics such as density, tortuosity, length, and width. These quantitative measurements are crucial, as they provide objective indicators for the detection and assessment of diabetic retinopathy. A Jupyter Notebook is appended in the repository to demonstrate the workflow and results.
